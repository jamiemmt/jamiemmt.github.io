  Assignments

<P>
  The written and programming assignments are the heart of this course
  and account for 45% of your grade.  Much of what you learn in this
  course will be through completing these assignments.  They must be
  done individually. If you download an assignment before it's "out"
  date, please be aware that the assignment may be modified between
  when you download it and the draft which we mean to release.

</P>

<H3><A NAME="policies">Collaboration and Academic Integrity</A></H3>

<P>
  The university policies and procedures on academic integrity will
be applied rigorously.
</P>

<P>
  The value of your degree depends on the academic integrity of
yourself and your peers in each of your classes. It is expected that,
unless otherwise instructed, the work you submit as your own will be
your own work and not someone else's work or a collaboration between
yourself and other(s). </P>

<P>Please read the <A
 HREF="http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/Cheating.html">University
Policy on Cheating and Plagiarism</A> carefully to understand the
penalties associated with academic dishonesty at CMU. In this class,
cheating/copying/plagiarism means copying all or part of a program or
homework solution from another student or unauthorized source such as
the Internet, knowingly giving such information to another student, or
giving or receiving unauthorized information during an examination. In
general, <STRONG>each solution you submit (quiz, written assignment,
programming assignment, midterm or final exam) must be your own
work</STRONG>. In the event that you use information written by
another person in your solution, you must cite the source of this
information (and receive prior permission if unsure whether this is
permitted).</P>

<P>Your course instructor reserves the right to determine an
appropriate penalty based on the violation of academic dishonesty that
occurs. <STRONG>Violations of the university policy can result in
severe penalties including failing this course and possible expulsion
from Carnegie Mellon University.</STRONG> If you have any questions
about this policy and any work you are doing in the course, please
feel free to contact your instructor for help.
</P>

<P>
  We will be using the <A HREF="http://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss">Moss</A>
system to detect software plagiarism.
</P>

<P>
  It is not considered cheating to clarify vague points in the
assignments, lectures, lecture notes, or to give help or receive help
in using the computer systems, compilers, debuggers, profilers, or
other facilities.
</P>

<H3>Due Dates and Late Days</H3>

<P>
  All handins of written assignments are on paper
at the beginning of lecture (9:00am) on the due date.
Assignments handed in after this time will receive
no credit.  There are no late days or partial credit
for late written assignments.
</P>

<P>
  All handins of programming assignments are electronic via hand-in
scripts on the university's linux systems.  You may submit
programs multiple times until they are due without penalty,
but only your final hand-in will be graded.
</P>

<P>
All programming assignments are due at 11:59pm on the specified due date.
<STRONG> There are no late days for the summer version of this course</STRONG>.
</P>

<P>
  Exceptions to the policies above will be granted only in
exceptional circumstances and must be discussed with and approved
by the course instructor <STRONG>in advance</STRONG>.
</P>

<H3>Grading</H3>

<P>
  Grading criteria are stated separately with each assignment.
</P>

<P>
  Grading for written assignments is based on the correctness of the
answer and the presentation of your reasoning.  Strive for clarity and
conciseness, but show how you arrived at the answer.  If you cannot
solve a problem, explaining your approach and why you failed is
encouraged.  Such answers will be given partial credit.
</P>

<P>
  The most important criterion for programming assignments is always
correctness. Buggy code is useless, and is likely to get a low score.
It is important that your code be readable and well-organized. This
includes proper use of contracts, invariants, and clear comments.
</P>

<P>
  Grades are based primarily on the total score for the class out of
1000 points. There are no predetermined cut-offs, but 900 and above is
guaranteed to be an A, 800 and above a B, etc. The teaching staff will
decide on grade boundaries at the end of the year. We will use
intangibles, such as participation in class and recitation for those
close to grade boundaries.
