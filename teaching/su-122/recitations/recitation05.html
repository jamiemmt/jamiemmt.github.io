<H2>Reviewing is_sorted</H2>
<P>
The function <TT>is_sorted</TT> is what we call a <I>specification function</I>. 
This function isn't meant to be run on its own to solve a problem. Instead
it's typically used in an annotation for another function to check for
correctness when we need it. For example, when we do linear search on a 
sorted array, how do we know that the array is sorted when the function
starts? We can call this specification function to check it for us, but
only if we're doing dynamic runtime testing using the <TT>-d</TT> option.
<P>
The following function returns true if the first n elements of the array A
are sorted in non-decreasing order (i.e. for any element, the next element 
is either the same or increasing). It returns false otherwise.
When we talked about an array being
sorted, we will usually mean this unless we specify otherwise.
<P>
<PRE>
bool is_sorted(int[] A, int n)
//@requires 0 <= n && n <= \length(A);
{
    for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++)
    //@loop_invariant n == 0 || (0 <= i && i <= n-1);
    {
        if (!(A[i] <= A[i+1])) return false;
    }
    return true;
}
</PRE>
<P>
Some points to consider:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Remember that the loop invariant must include the value of the loop 
variable i when the loop condition is tested the last time (i.e. when
the loop is about to terminate.	
<P>
In this case, since n could be 0, we need to explicitly test for this
otherwise the rest of the invariant would be false and the code would
cause an annotation failure.  In this case, the order that we test
the two separate conditions for <TT>n</TT> and <TT>i</TT> does not 
matter, even with short-circuit evaluation. But we tend to write the
special case first (<TT>n == 0</TT>) and then the general case next.
<P>
The <TT>return</TT> statement in C0 returns immediately from the 
function, even if additional statements follow it.  So if we find
a pair of adjacent array values that are not in the correct order,
we don't need to check the rest of the array since the array can't 
possibly be sorted, so we immediately return false. If we get through
the whole loop without returning false, then when we exit, we return
true.
<P>
Since this is being treated as a specification function, we generally
do not write postconditions for this function.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

<a name="isin">
<H2>Reviewing is_in</H2>
<P>
The function <TT>is_in</TT> is also a specification function, to be used
to test assertions in other functions. Effectively, this function is the
simplest form of a linear search which assumes nothing about the order
of the data. 
<P>
The following function returns true if the integer <TT>x</TT> is in 
the integer array <TT>A</TT> in one of the first <TT>n</TT> positions;
false otherwise.
<P>
<PRE>
bool is_in(int x, int[] A, int n)
//@requires 0 <= n && n <= \length(A);
{
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    //@loop_invariant 0 <= i && i <= n;
    {
        if (A[i] == x) return true;
    }
    return false;
}
</PRE>
<P>
Some points to consider:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In this function, the loop invariant can have <TT>i</TT> going up to <TT>n</TT>
since we may have to examine every element of the array up to position 
<TT>n-1</TT>.
<P>
Note that we don't have to check for <TT>n == 0</TT> in this loop invariant.
(Why?)
<P>
Whenever you write an <TT>if</TT> statement, you don't need to have an
<TT>else</TT> statement with it. You only need an <TT>else</TT> statement
if you need to do something if the condition is not true. So PLEASE do NOT
write things like this:
<P>
<PRE>
  if (A[i] == x) return true;
  else x = x;                      // OUCH, THIS HURTS MY HEAD!

  if (!(A[i] == x)) i = i + 0;     // AGONY! AGONY!
  else return true; 
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
In these two specification functions, the variable <TT>i</TT> is defined
locally for the loop only since we declare it in the <TT>for</TT> construct.
We cannot access <TT>i</TT> once the loop terminates. If  you need to 
access <TT>i</TT> for some reason after the loop terminates, declare the
variable <TT>i</TT> as an <TT>int</TT> before you get to the loop, and then 
just write <TT>for (i = 0; ...etc</TT> to start your loop.
<P>

<a name="linsearch">
<H2>Linear Search: Reasoning with Invariants (Again)</H2>
<P>
Let's take another loop at linear search, assuming that the array we're
given is already sorted:
<P>
<PRE>
int linsearch(int x, int[] A, int n)
//@requires 0 <= n && n <= \length(A);
//@requires is_sorted(A,n);
{   
    for (int i = 0; i < n && A[i] <= x; i++)
    //@loop_invariant 0 <= i && i <= n;
    //@loop_invariant i == 0 || A[i-1] < x;
    {
        if (A[i] == x) return i;
    }
    return -1;
}
</PRE>
<P>
This function returns the index of the first occurrence of <TT>x</TT> in 
the first <TT>n</TT> elements of the array <TT>A</TT>, or -1 if not found.
<P>
Let's look at the second loop invariant more carefully. First, it uses a
programming technique called <I>short-circuit evaluation</I> (or sometimes
called <I>lazy evaluation</I>) where the second condition is evaluated
at runtime only if necessary. In this example, if i is equal to 0, then the
invariant is true so there is no need to test the second condition. In fact,
this is desired since A[i-1] will yield an array index out of bounds
exception when i equals 0. In general, if we have the condition A || B, if
A is true, B is not evaluated. If we have the condition A && B, if A is
false, B is not evaluated. So be careful, in programming languages that
provide short-circuit evaluation, A || B does not always yield the same
result as B || A. The order does matter sometimes, and we will take
advantage of this sometimes.
<P>
Now let's look at the invariant:
<P>
<PRE>
i == 0 || A[i-1] < x
</PRE>
<P>
If this condition is true at the start of a loop iteration, is it true
at the end of an iteration?
<P>
When we test the
loop condition the first time, the invariant holds trivially. After the each
iteration is complete, i' = i + 1, so we wish to show that
<P>
<PRE>
A[i'-1] < x ==> A[i+1-1] < x ==> A[i] < x
</PRE>
(Note: i==0 is only relevant for the
start of the first iteration, otherwise i==0 is false and we need to test the
2nd condition.)
<P>
The loop iteration starts with A[i] <= x and to get to the end of the iteration
(without returning from the function), A[i] != x. Thus, A[i] < x.
<P>
Now, let's determine appropriate postconditions for this function based
on what we know about the preconditions and the loop invariants.
<P>
First, we know that the result that gets returned is either -1 or an
integer between 0 and n-1 inclusive. So we can write:
<P>
<PRE>
//@ensures -1 <= \result && \result < n;
</PRE>
<P>
Next, we know that if the 
returned result is -1, then the value stored in <TT>x</TT>
is not in the array in the first <TT>n</TT> positions.
If the returned result is in the range 0 to n-1 inclusive,
then we know that this is the first occurrence of <TT>x</TT>, so
<TT>x</TT> cannot be in positions 0 through <TT>\result - 1</TT>.
Thus, for our next postcondition, we have to satisfy one of the two
conditions above, so we can write:
<P>
<PRE>
  /*@ensures (\result == -1 && !is_in(x,A,n)) 
             || (A[\result] == x && !is_in(x,A,\result));  
    @*/
</PRE>
<P>
Note the special syntax for an annotation that takes up more than one line.
(Why did we choose to use one more line here and not just write the entire
precondition in one line?)
<P>
<I>Exercise</I>: Rewrite the postcondition above so that it doesn't
call <TT>is_in</TT> if <TT>A[\result] == x</TT>. Does this improve
the code? Why or why not?
<P>
