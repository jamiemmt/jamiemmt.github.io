<H2>Navigating your account in Linux</H2>
<P>
Open up a Terminal window to access the Linux command prompt. (Unlike
typical graphical interfaces for operating systems, here you are entering 
commands directly to the OS and can change hundreds of options to give 
finer control of what you're doing.) On the Linux machines in the computer 
labs in Gates (rooms 5205, 5201, and 3000), you can access a Terminal 
window using the Applications --&gt; Accessories menus.
<P>
In the Gates computer labs, your terminal window will give you a prompt 
and you will be in your home directory in your Andrew account. Type 
<TT>ls</TT> (to list files) to see what files and directories are there. 
Back in the day, we used to call folders "directories". To move to another 
directory, use the <TT>cd</TT> command (for "change directory"):
<P>
<TT>cd private</TT>
<P>
<B>ACADEMIC INTEGRITY NOTE: You should store your program files inside the 
<TT>private</TT> 
directory (or a subdirectory inside this directory) since this 
directory is automatically set to prevent viewing by other users. Remember 
that you should protect your code from being viewed by other students as 
part of the academic integrity policy for this course.</B>
<P>
Since you will write a number of programs for this course, it pays to make 
a subdirectory inside the <TT>private</TT> directory. Once you <TT>cd</TT>
into the <TT>private</TT> directory, make a new directory named 15122:
<P>
<TT>mkdir 15122</TT>
<P>
Now go into this directory using <TT>cd</TT> again:
<P>
<TT>cd 15122</TT>
<P>
To go back up one directory if you need to, use this command:
<P>
<TT>cd ..</TT>
<P>
You can go up two directories and down another directory (e.g. public) 
like this:
<P>
<TT>cd ../../public</TT>
<P>
If you ever get lost while you change from one directory to another, you 
can use <TT>pwd</TT> to find your present working directory. Or if you 
want to go back to your home directory, simple type:
<P>
<TT>cd</TT>
<P>
You can also access any directory from your home directory using the shell 
variable <TT>$HOME</TT> or the "tilde" character <TT>~</TT>. For example, you
can get to your 15122 directory from any directory on Andrew by typing this:
<P>
<TT>cd $HOME/private/15122</TT>
<P>
or this:
<P>
<TT>cd ~/private/15122</TT>
<P>
<B>LOGGING OUT: 
Remember that you must log out from the computer in the Gates lab. Closing 
the terminal window is not enough! To log out, go to the System menu
and choose Log Out. You don't want others accessing your account if you 
leave yourself logged in.
</B>
<P>
<B>COURTESY NOTE: In the Gates labs, if you don't use your lab computer 
for a set period of time, the screen saver will launch and you can't 
access the terminal unless you type your password in. Some students have 
left the computer this way so they can "reserve" the machine for 
themselves later. If we find a machine in screen saver mode and no user 
at that terminal, we will automatically log you out so you may lose work 
if you're not careful. Please be considerate of others and don't lock the 
terminal.</B>

<a name="editing">

<H2>Setting up Your Account for C0 mode and running the compiler and Editing your program</H2>
<P>
You can use any editor you wish to write and edit your programs but we 
highly recommend you try out emacs since this editor can do much more than 
just help you edit your code (as you will see).
<P>
To set up emacs for your Andrew account, you will need to create a 
configuration file 
named <TT>.emacs</TT> in your home directory. 
Run the following <TT>configure</TT>
command located in the course directory and redirect the output into
the <TT>.emacs</TT> file:<P>
<PRE>
/afs/andrew/course/15/122/c0-mode/configure >> ~/.emacs
</PRE>
<P>
When you want to edit a program now, you can enter emacs specifying the 
file name you want to edit. You should be in the directory where the file 
is or should be (to keep things simple for now). For example, to open the 
file test.c0 in emacs, you'd go to the directory where this file should be
stored and enter:
<P>
<TT>emacs test.c0</TT>
<P>
If the file exists, it will be loaded into the emacs editor. If the file 
does not exist, you will get a blank editor to start typing in the code.
The configuration file <TT>.emacs</TT> you edited earlier will add color 
coding to your c0 programs. Keywords will show up in one color, variables 
in another, etc. This will make it easier to edit your program code.
<P>
<B>FOR MORE INFORMATION:</B>
<P>
<a href="http://www.linuxhelp.net/guides/emacs">LinuxHelp.next Emacs Help</a>
<P>
<a name="compiling">

<P>
Before you compile programs, you should update your path in your 
Andrew account so the system can find the C0 compiler without you having to 
explicitly give the full path to the compiler's location.
<P>
To update your path, use emacs to edit the file <TT>.cshrc</TT> found in 
your home directory when you log in:
<P>
<TT>emacs .cshrc</TT>
<P>
Add the following line at the end of your <TT>.cshrc</TT> file exactly as 
shown:
<P>
<TT>setenv PATH ${PATH}:/afs/andrew/course/15/122/bin</TT>
<P>
Save the file and exit emacs. For this time only, you can have the system 
run this resource file immediately by entering the following at the Linux 
prompt in your terminal window:
<P>
<TT>source .cshrc</TT>
<P>
(When you log in next time, this file is "sourced" automatically.) If you 
use a different shell than csh, you will need to adjust your path 
accordingly. See your TA or CA if you need more help.
<P>

<a name="#ssh">
<H2>Accessing your Andrew files using ssh</H2>
<P>
You can always access your Andrew files on the Andrew Linux server in the 
Gates labs (rooms 5205, 5201, and 3000) when the labs have no classes 
scheduled. In addition, you can access your files via <TT>ssh</TT> in 
several ways. <TT>ssh</TT> (secure shell) a protocol for securely logging
into remote servers like the Andrew system.
<P>
<I>Windows machines</I>: Download a free ssh client like PuTTY. When you 
log in, specify the server <TT>linux.andrew.cmu.edu</TT>.
<P>
In the Windows clusters on campus, you should run X-Win32 first and
then use an SSH client like SSH Tectia-Terminal to log in to
<TT>linux.andrew.cmu.edu</TT>. By having the X-Win32 program running,
all "windows" that you open up when logged into andrew (e.g. when you
run emacs) will appear on your local Windows console. 
<P>
<I>Mac and Linux machines</I>: Open up a terminal window and run this 
command:
<P>
<TT>ssh -X -l yourusername linux.andrew.cmu.edu</TT>
<P>
and enter your password when prompted to log in. (Your machine might ask 
if you want to add the server to a list of known hosts; if so, answer 
yes.)
