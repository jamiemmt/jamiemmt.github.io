<H2>Reviewing binary search</H2>
<P>
Recall the code for binary search given in lecture:
<P>
<PRE>
int binsearch(int x, int[] A, int n)
//@requires 0 <= n && n <= \length(A);
//@requires is_sorted(A, n);
/*@ensures (-1 == \result && !is_in(x, A, n))
        || ((0 <= \result && \result < n) && A[\result] == x);
  @*/
{
  int lower = 0;
  int upper = n;
  while (lower < upper)
    //@loop_invariant 0 <= lower && lower <= upper && upper <= n;
    //@loop_invariant (lower == 0 || A[lower-1] < x);
    //@loop_invariant (upper == n || A[upper] > x);
    {
      int mid = lower + (upper-lower)/2;
      //@assert lower <= mid && mid < upper;
      if (A[mid] == x) 
           return mid;
      else if (A[mid] > x) 
           upper = mid;
      else //@assert A[mid] < x;
           lower = mid+1;
    }
  return -1;
}
</PRE>
<P>
Note in the postcondition (<TT>ensures</TT>) that if <TT>A[\result]==x</TT>,
we can't also say that <TT>!is_in(x, A, \result)</TT> like we could using 
linear search. Why? Remember that there can be duplicates in an array so
there could be more than one value that matches <TT>x</TT> in the array.
Since binary search does not search linearly from the beginning of the 
array, the first match it encounters (if any) might not be the <I>first</I>
occurrence of <TT>x</TT> starting from the beginning of the array.
<P>
If an array has <I>n</I> integers in it, how many times will the loop
iterate in the worst case? If you examine the binary search algorithm,
you see that after each iteration, our search range (from <TT>lower</TT>
to <TT>upper</TT>-1) halves.  So how many times can we divide <TT>n</TT> 
by 2 before we reach a search range of size 1?  Call this <TT>i</TT>.
We want <I>n</I>/2<SUP><I>i</I></SUP> to be 1. So <I>n</I>=2<SUP><I>i</I></SUP>
and <I>i</I> = log<SUB>2</SUB><I>n</I>. This is a <I>logarithmic</I> 
algorithm since the execution time depends on the log of the number
of items in the array. Using Big O notation, we'd say that binary search
is O(log n).
<P>
Remember that we can only use binary search if the data in the array
is already sorted. If it wasn't sorted, would it pay to use binary
search to find a data value in the array? If you need to find a
sequence of values, then it pays to sort first, and then use
binary search which is faster in the worst case than linear search.
But if you only have to look for one element and never look at the
data again, it doesn't pay to sort, since it has been shown that sorts
that depend on comparing two items at a time can't do better than
O(n log n) in the worst case. Doing a simple linear search (without sorting)
if you only need to search for only one item would be faster
in the worst case, but not by much since the difference between n
and n log n isn't that significant due to the log n factor. Remember that
as n increases, log n grows very slowly.
<P>

<a name="invariant">
<H2>Analyzing the invariants</H2>
<P>
Let's analyze each of the invariants to see that they hold for the loop
in binary search.
<P>
Clearly, the invariants are true just before the loop condition is 
tested for the first time:
<P>
<PRE>
Know: lower = 0, upper = n, and 0 <= n (from precondition).

Invariants:

0 <= lower && lower <= upper && upper <= n
0 <= 0     &&    0  <=  n    &&   n   <= n
 true      &&     true       &&    true     = true

lower == 0 || A[lower-1] < x
0 == 0     || A[lower-1] < x
true, using short circuit evaluation

upper == n || A[upper] > x
n == n     || A[upper] > x
true, using short circuit evaluation
</PRE>
<P>
Now, if the invariants are true at the start of an iteration, are they
true at the end of an iteration?
<P>
Assume:
0 <= lower && lower <= upper && upper <= n;
(lower == 0 || A[lower-1] < x);
(upper == n || A[upper] > x);

Know:
mid' = lower + (upper-lower)/2;

Show:
0 <= lower' && lower' <= upper' && upper' <= n;
(lower' == 0 || A[lower'-1] < x);
(upper' == n || A[upper'] > x);
</PRE>
<P>
<I>Case 1</I>: <TT>A[mid] > x</TT>
<P>
<PRE>
Also know:  
A[mid'] > x
upper' = mid'
lower' = lower
lower <= mid' && mid' < upper

0 <= lower' && lower' <= upper' && upper' <= n;
0 <= lower  && lower  <= mid'   && mid' <= n;
true        &&    true          && true        (since mid' < upper <= n)

lower' == 0 || A[lower'-1] < x
Since lower doesn't change in this iteration:
lower == 0 || A[lower-1] < x which is true by our assumption.

upper' == n || A[upper'] > x
mid' == n || A[mid'] > x == true since we only have to satisfy one condition
in an or condition to get true as a result
</PRE>
<P>
<I>Exercise</I>: <I>Case 2</I>: Show that the invariants hold if A[mid] < x.
<P>
Assuming the invariants hold, how can we show that we get the desired
postcondition as specified?  
<P>
Case 1: x is not in the array
<P>
This means that when the loop terminates and returns -1, we know that
lower >= upper. But the loop invariant says lower <= upper also. 
Thus, lower == upper. So plugging into the other invariants:
<P>
<PRE>
(lower == 0 || A[lower-1 < x]) && (upper == n || A[upper] > x)
(upper == 0 || A[upper-1 < x]) && (upper == n || A[upper] > x)
If upper == 0, then A[0] > x which means x is not in the array
(since the array is sorted).
If upper == n, then A[n-1] < x which means x is not in the array (same reason).
If upper is not equal to 0 or n, then:
A[upper-1 < x] && A[upper] > x
Since the array is sorted, x is not in the array.
So we return -1 correctly.
</PRE>
<P>
Case 2: x is in the array
<P>
If x is in the array, A[mid] == x and we return mid, 
satisfying A[\result] == x. Also, we should make sure mid
satisfies (0 <= \result && \result < n). This can be shown
since right before we return mid, we know:
<P>
<PRE>
0 <= lower && lower <= upper && upper <= n
and
lower <= mid && mid < upper
</PRE>
<P>
So <TT>mid</TT> must also be in the range [0,n).
